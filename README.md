#### Description: Split the Count! is a web application that allows you and your friends to create different bills, load payments for each of them and then you can check your balance and who you owe money. Perfect for trips or meals, where you might have a lot of expenses that you need to split among some people.

# How to Use!

- Go to Register to create an account. You will be needing a secure password. Otherwise, Jim from the Office will tell you to try again!

- Go to Log In to put your username and password to enter!

- On index, you can see your accounts and your balance in each of them.

- Go to New Count to create an account. Select number of users, then a name for the account and the users involved! And that's it.

- Go to New Pay to add a payment. You will be asked for a Title, an amount of money, who paid, and for whom applies to!

#### This is where I struggle the most, because I had to put queries into selectors, so I used JavaScript for it. You select an account, so then and just then, you are allowed to put who paid (a query for that account) and also it has a multiple selector that allows you to put for which users the pay applies to. It is the same query as before, but in this case, allows the program to calculate how much each one has to pay.

#### That's where this tool becomes handy, because you can add pays that are for everyone, but maybe you paid something for three people, or someone paid something just for you, so you can add this and the program will take care, if you put the correct users in the multiple selector.

- Add all the pays you want, then go to "My Counts" where you can access your accounts. When you select one, you can see the balance that you and your crew have! which is a query from a database that updates itself whenever you add a pay, and the details of each one of your accounts. 

- You can see who paid, as a positive balance, and who owes money, the balance of each person and who made the paids. Also you can see datetime and title, so you can remember what was the expense.

- Create as much accounts as you wish. There's no limit!

- You don't need to register users for all your friends, but if you do, your friend can log in with it and also see the balance and load pays. In other words, any user can load pays if they are in the account. So be sure you add your friends!
